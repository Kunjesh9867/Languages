## Introduction
- In this repository, I have attached all my arduino files which I was taught in my IoT using Arduino course.
- Due to Covid, my course was online so I created Arduino circuits in Tinkercad web app. 
- Every folder has atleast 2 files, one for Code and other for Circuit Diagram.
 - I used C++ programming for this course.
 - The live circuit can be found at my Tinkercad ID which can be available on request.
