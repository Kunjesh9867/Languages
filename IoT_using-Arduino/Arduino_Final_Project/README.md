=> Introduction
In the final project, I created five different files. Each file performs different functionality.

=>Technology used
C++
Tinkercad

=> Concepts Used
(1) loops(if, if-else, if/else-if ladder, for, while)
(2) nested Loops
(3) array
(4) functions
(5) different datatypes according to the need
(6) effective use of Serial.println()
(7) taking input from the user using Serial.available()
(8) define notes for the song
(9) using digitalRead() & digitalWrite() function for light show
(10) using TimeLapse for Door Buzzer and Ultrasonic Sensor

=> Game features
(A) Initially, the user will get general information about the game and the initial screen of the program.
(B) Now, the user has to choose from the 5 different options, which are (1)quiz game (2) song with light show (3) Advanced light show (4) Ultrasonic sensor (5) door buzzer.
(C) According to the user input, the program will run.
(D)If the user chooses a quiz game, an initial screen stating the game's rules and regulations will have appeared. Now the game will start and the user will get an update on their performance.
(E) If the user chooses a song with a light show, the user will get an option to pick from 3 different songs with a cutting-edge light show.
(F) If the user chooses an advanced light show, an eye-catching light show will be presented to the user.
(G) If the user chooses the Ultrasonic sensor, an ultrasonic sensor will be presented and the user can be able to test the sensor. 
(H) If the user chooses the Door Buzzer, a door buzzer will be presented and the user can be able to test the sensor.
